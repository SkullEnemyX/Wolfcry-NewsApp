# WolfCry News App

Well, the wolfcry news app is built in flutter thus bringing the same source code to both android and iOS.
This news app allows you to select from over 130 channels and bring the latest feed from your favourite source giving users the flexibility of realying on the channel that they trust.
Since this app is made in India thus when the app is opened for the first time, "The Times of India" comes as pre-subscribed but can easily be removed
and newer news sources can be added from the subscription tab .

This news app brings one of the most intuitive design.
News is fetched from Newsapi.org.

According to personal preferences, one can select from the dark/light theme that the app offers.

There is a search bar where the users can select the hot topics if it is in their subscribed feed and directly read the shortened version.

This app allows users to either view the news in a short summary or visit the news' own website to get a full-insight of the presented topic.
